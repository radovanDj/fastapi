Option 2: Download using git command-line

You also have the option to download source code using git command-line.

git clone
" https://github.com/codingwithroby/fastapi-the-complete-course.git "



Note: Option 1 and Option 2 both reference the exact same code. You only need to choose one of the options.



Important:

For Option 1 or Option 2, navigate to the file that have requirements.txt in it.

In terminal type 

" pip install -r requirements.txt "

This will download all dependencies to your machine!

Cheers :)
